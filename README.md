# BigInt Library

BigInt is a C++ library for performing arithmetic operations on large integers that are beyond the limit of built-in data types.

## Features

- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of large integers.
- Power and modulus operations.
- Increment and decrement operators.
- Comparison operators (equality, inequality, less than, greater than, less than or equal to, greater than or equal to).
- Conversion to string and integer.
- Random number generation within a given range.

## Usage

Include the `BigInt.h` file in your project and create `BigInt` objects. A sample main.cpp is included to test the functionality and showcases how to use the library.

### One of the major constraints of this project was to utilize only <string> library, <cstdlib> is used for generating random numbers, it can be removed along with the random function if not required.
